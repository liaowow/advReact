Coding along with Wes Bos' [Fullstack Advanced React and GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) course

### Tech Stack for Sick Fits
- Frontend
  - **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: Good at taking data, putting it into templates, rendering it into DOM, and updating efficiently
  - **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: Framework for React, takes care of routing, linking pages, lazy-loading, and server-side rendering
    - Can also be statically-rendered, i.e. can pre-render the content at build time
    - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-react-router): Migrating from React Router
  - **[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/)**: Allows us to fetch, load data, or push data onto our actual server
  - **[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)**: Creates scoped CSS (reusable styles) in React
- Backend
  - **[Keystone.js](https://www.keystonejs.com/)**: Framework that gives us a headless CMS, provides GraphQL API based on all of the CRUD operations in our CMS
    - Node
    - MongoDB

### [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Styled-components is a library that helps you create React components already with a style. 
- It removes the mapping between components and styles. This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component that has your styles attached to it.
